## Don't like it? Make it better!
I've written this code for anyone to use, to get inspiration and to learn new concepts. I learned a lot from other people's code, and this is my way of returning the favour. The day I'm not learning new things any more is the day I quit. That means this code is not perfect. See anything conceptually incorrect? Please let me know. Please refer to literature where these concepts are described. That way I can learn new things. Feel free to make a pull request, too!
