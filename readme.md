This code-base is my interpretation of Command Query Responsibility Segregation, Domain-Driven Design, and Hexagonal/Ports and Adapter.

I've written what I've learned in the following blogs:

* This blog briefly describes the concepts: [Implementing DDDomain models, ports & adapters and CQRS with C#](https://medium.com/@abstarreveld/implementing-dddomain-models-ports-adapters-and-cqrs-with-c-2b81403f09f7?source=friends_link&sk=5d712709ae5de5454bd84e88d62beb2c)
* This blog describes the folder structure, project structure, etc, that's been applied in this repo: [DDDomain models, ports & adapters and CQRS reference architecture (C#)](https://medium.com/@abstarreveld/dddomain-models-ports-adapters-and-cqrs-reference-architecture-c-504817df65ec)
* This blog describes the testing concepts: [How to test a microservice](https://medium.com/@abstarreveld/how-to-test-a-microservice-4be1b5908f9).

I've written this code for anyone to use, to get inspiration and to learn new concepts. I learned a lot from other people's code, and this is my way of returning the favor. The day I'm not learning new things anymore is the day I quit. That means this code is not perfect. See anything conceptually incorrect? Please let me know. Please refer to the literature where these concepts are described. That way I can learn new things. Feel free to make a pull request, too!
